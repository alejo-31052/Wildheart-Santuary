            PawFund was created with a simple but powerful mission: to connect animal lovers with shelters in need of
            support. We believe that every animal deserves love, care, and a safe place to call home.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            By creating a platform that makes it easy to discover and donate to animal shelters, we aim to increase the
            resources available to these vital organizations and help more animals find their forever homes.

                We provide a platform for animal shelters to showcase their work, share their needs, and receive
                donations. Our shelter registration process ensures that all organizations on our platform are
                legitimate and dedicated to animal welfare.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Our Story</h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
            PawFund was founded in 2023 by a group of animal lovers who saw a need for a better way to connect donors
            with animal shelters. After volunteering at various shelters, our founders noticed that many organizations
            struggled with fundraising and visibility, despite doing vital work in their communities.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
            Inspired by crowdfunding platforms but focused specifically on the needs of animal welfare organizations,
            PawFund was born. Since our launch, we've helped connect thousands of donors with shelters across the
            country, resulting in better care for countless animals in need.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            Today, we continue to grow our platform, adding new features and shelters to make an even bigger impact in
            the world of animal welfare.
